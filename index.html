        <p>
          Jay McCarthy is a Christian songwriter and storyteller who writes with conviction, clarity, and purpose. His music cuts through the noise—centered on truth, not trends. Every line is built to mean something, with no wasted words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raised in Massachusetts, Jay found his voice early through poetry and personal reflection. Over time, that voice became music—rooted in scripture, shaped by life experience, and unafraid to confront hard truths.
        </p>
        <p>
          His songs deal with themes of spiritual warfare, identity in Christ, and standing firm in faith when culture pulls the other way. <em>Unafraid</em> and <em>Stand Upon Your Name</em> reflect that mission clearly—calling believers to boldness without compromise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jay creates from the Carolinas where he’s actively involved in <a href="https://www.rockc3.com" class="text-blue-600 underline" target="_blank">The Rock Church</a>. His work isn’t detached—it’s part of how he lives out his faith. He writes songs, not slogans. He speaks to the believer who’s been through it and still refuses to bow.
